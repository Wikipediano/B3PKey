# B3PKey
 This is the first custom keyboard that I have designed.
 It is an ortholinear 75% keyboard which, when completed, will have been entirely designed and built by me.
 
 I have been inspired to do this project by u/JustOneMorePixel, and I have gone through ai03's book *PCB Design* and Hadi Iskandarani's YouTube series *PCB Design for Mechanical Keyboards*.
