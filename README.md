# B3PKey
 This is the first custom keyboard that I have designed.
 It is an ortholinear 75% keyboard which, when completed, will have been entirely designed and built by me.
 
 I have been inspired to do this project by a href=httpswww.reddit.comuserJustOneMorePixeluJustOneMorePixela, and I have gone through ai03's book a href=httpswiki.ai03.combookspcb-designPCB Designa and Hadi Iskandarani's YouTube series a href=httpswww.youtube.complaylistlist=PLbtY7JsOJDYkHNuTmBtGgaWv_qipKeL-uPCB Design for Mechanical Keyboardsa.
