# B3PKey
 This is the first custom keyboard that I have designed.
 It is an ortholinear 75% keyboard which, when completed, will have been entirely designed and built by me.
 
 I have been inspired to do this project by u/JustOneMorePixel and I have gone through ai03's PCB design tutorial and Hadi Iskandarani's (YouTube) PCB Design for Mechanical Keyboards series.
