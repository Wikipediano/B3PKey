# B3PKey
 This is the first custom keyboard that I have designed.
 It is an ortholinear 75% keyboard which, when completed, will have been entirely designed and built by me.
 
 I have been inspired to do this project by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JustOneMorePixel">u/JustOneMorePixel</a>, and I have gone through ai03's book <a href="https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design">*PCB Design*</a> and Hadi Iskandarani's YouTube series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbtY7JsOJDYkHNuTmBtGgaWv_qipKeL-u">*PCB Design for Mechanical Keyboards*</a>.
